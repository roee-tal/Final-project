###  Sources(Literature survey):
[Source #1](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/331692/what-algorithm-is-used-by-elevators-to-find-the-shortest-path-to-travel-floor-or) - great answers to cut the total waiting times.

[Source #2](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~ai/projects/2014/The_intelevator/files/report.pdf) - 
quality job which explaines the principle's of the elevator's movement and gave us good inspiration.

[Source #2](https://www.i-programmer.info/programmer-puzzles/203-sharpen-your-coding-skills/4561-sharpen-your-coding-skills-elevator-puzzle.html?start=1) - also good principle's of the elevator's movement and emphasis to weak point on designing elevator's movement.
